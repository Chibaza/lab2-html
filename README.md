
This lab focused on building a properly structured HTML5 webpage using semantic elements. It included creating a simple webpage with a navigation menu, a main content section, a sidebar, and a footer. Additionally, a contact form with built-in HTML5 validation was implemented to ensure proper user input. The HTML code was validated using the W3C Validator to confirm compliance with web standards. Finally, the project was managed with Git, uploaded to GitHub, and a collaboration task was completed by forking and modifying a partner's repository.
